RAMPART
This folder contains protocol configuration files for running RAMPART.
HIV amplicon: 1.3kb (partial pol).

This protocol, <rampart-HIV-1_partial-pol_2030-3400>, uses a reference limited to the pol region of the HIV-1 genome (coordinates: 2030â€“3400).
Note: This configuration does not include the full HXB2 genome. If you prefer to map against the entire reference genome, please use the <rampart-HIV-1_partial-pol> protocol available in the same repository.
